Description: reflex - fast lexical analyzer generator
 Reflex is a tool for generating scanners (programs which recognize
 lexical patterns in text).  It reads the given input files for a
 description of a scanner to generate.  The description is in the form of
 pairs of regular expressions and C code, called rules.  Reflex generates
 as output a C source file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex(). 
 This file is compiled and linked with the -lrefl library to produce an
 executable.  When the executable is run, it analyzes its input for
 occurrences of the regular expressions.  Whenever it finds one, it
 executes the corresponding C code.
 .
 This is based on flex 2.5.4a, and unlike so-called "new" flex,
 remains compatible with POSIX lex.
